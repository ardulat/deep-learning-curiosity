# Deep Learning Curiosity

This is a repository of my personal curiosity in deep learning. I post interesting papers, my writings, and reproduced models here.

## Getting Started

This is how the repository is organized:

* [Books related to deep learning](https://github.com/ardulat/deep-learning-curiosity/tree/master/Books)
* [Papers that I have read](https://github.com/ardulat/deep-learning-curiosity/tree/master/Read)
* [Papers that I find interesting and plan to read](https://github.com/ardulat/deep-learning-curiosity/tree/master/To%20be%20read)
* [My writings in LaTeX](https://github.com/ardulat/deep-learning-curiosity/tree/master/Writings)
* [Models I have reproduced](https://github.com/ardulat/deep-learning-curiosity/tree/master/Reproduced%20models)


## Contributing

Feel free to email me at anuar.maratkhan@nu.edu.kz regarding anything related to the repo (e.g. sharing interesting papers, asking for an advice, etc.).

## Versioning

This repo is permanently updating because I read papers and discover deep learning in my spare time out of a curiosity.
